Yet another collection of useful small scripts

Here at Jiabin we believe that documentations are overrated. Who needs a 15 pages long file that bosses you around. Besides being incomplete, clunky and often outdated, an evil documentation can also erode your self-esteem and embarrass you in front of other co-workers.

Today we are giving you the chance to stand up and fight back. No more documentations, wikis or "[instantly beautiful project pages](https://github.com/blog/1081-instantly-beautiful-project-pages)".

You are on your own this time. Stay safe,

By the developer that didn't have the time to write 2 lines of documentation but instead wasted his time writing this.
